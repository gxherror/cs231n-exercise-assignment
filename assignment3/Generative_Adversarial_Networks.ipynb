    "# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in CS 231N, all the applications of neural networks that we have explored have been **discriminative models** that take an input and are trained to produce a labeled output. This has ranged from straightforward classification of image categories to sentence generation (which was still phrased as a classification problem, our labels were in vocabulary space and weâ€™d learned a recurrence to capture multi-word labels). In this notebook, we will expand our repetoire, and build **generative models** using neural networks. Specifically, we will learn how to build models which generate novel images that resemble a set of training images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a GAN?\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2014, [Goodfellow et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) presented a method for training generative models called Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs for short). In a GAN, we build two different neural networks. Our first network is a traditional classification network, called the **discriminator**. We will train the discriminator to take images and classify them as being real (belonging to the training set) or fake (not present in the training set). Our other network, called the **generator**, will take random noise as input and transform it using a neural network to produce images. The goal of the generator is to fool the discriminator into thinking the images it produced are real.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of this back and forth process of the generator ($G$) trying to fool the discriminator ($D$) and the discriminator trying to correctly classify real vs. fake as a minimax game:\n",
    "$$\\underset{G}{\\text{minimize}}\\; \\underset{D}{\\text{maximize}}\\; \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p_\\text{data}}\\left[\\log D(x)\\right] + \\mathbb{E}_{z \\sim p(z)}\\left[\\log \\left(1-D(G(z))\\right)\\right]$$\n",
    "where $z \\sim p(z)$ are the random noise samples, $G(z)$ are the generated images using the neural network generator $G$, and $D$ is the output of the discriminator, specifying the probability of an input being real. In [Goodfellow et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661), they analyze this minimax game and show how it relates to minimizing the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the training data distribution and the generated samples from $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To optimize this minimax game, we will aternate between taking gradient *descent* steps on the objective for $G$ and gradient *ascent* steps on the objective for $D$:\n",
    "1. update the **generator** ($G$) to minimize the probability of the __discriminator making the correct choice__. \n",
    "2. update the **discriminator** ($D$) to maximize the probability of the __discriminator making the correct choice__.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these updates are useful for analysis, they do not perform well in practice. Instead, we will use a different objective when we update the generator: maximize the probability of the **discriminator making the incorrect choice**. This small change helps to allevaiate problems with the generator gradient vanishing when the discriminator is confident. This is the standard update used in most GAN papers and was used in the original paper from [Goodfellow et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will alternate the following updates:\n",
    "1. Update the generator ($G$) to maximize the probability of the discriminator making the incorrect choice on generated data:\n",
    "$$\\underset{G}{\\text{maximize}}\\;  \\mathbb{E}_{z \\sim p(z)}\\left[\\log D(G(z))\\right]$$\n",
    "2. Update the discriminator ($D$), to maximize the probability of the discriminator making the correct choice on real and generated data:\n",
    "$$\\underset{D}{\\text{maximize}}\\; \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p_\\text{data}}\\left[\\log D(x)\\right] + \\mathbb{E}_{z \\sim p(z)}\\left[\\log \\left(1-D(G(z))\\right)\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of what your outputs from the 3 different models you're going to train should look like. Note that GANs are sometimes finicky, so your outputs might not look exactly like this. This is just meant to be a *rough* guideline of the kind of quality you can expect:"

    " GANs are notoriously finicky with hyperparameters, and also require many training epochs. In order to make this assignment approachable without a GPU, we will be working on the MNIST dataset, which is 60,000 training and 10,000 test images. Each picture contains a centered image of white digit on black background (0 through 9). This was one of the first datasets used to train convolutional neural networks and it is fairly easy -- a standard CNN model can easily exceed 99% accuracy. \n",

See the [documentation](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/master/torchvision/datasets/mnist.py) for more information about the interface. The default parameters will take 5,000 of the training examples and place them into a validation dataset. The data will be saved into a folder called `MNIST_data`. "
